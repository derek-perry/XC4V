Third-Person Wave Defense Sci-Fi Combat Game

Game made in Unreal Engine for a SCAD Game Design course. The SCAD project called for completing a Game Design idea using Unreal Engine with a focus on holistic design principles.

This was a project completed in a group of four students. My role was to design the systems and blueprint tech; combat, movement, other character interactions/variables, enemy AI, and the base/wave defense mechanics. My three group members provided the concept art as well as character, environment, and prop art assets along with sounds and menus.

Made Using:  Adobe Photoshop  Adobe Illustrator  Autodesk Maya  Substance Designer  Substance Painter  Unreal Engine 4
